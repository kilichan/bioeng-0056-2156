# Contributing

My hope is that this curriculum is developed completely in the open. All stakeholders -- future students, current students, and faculty -- will feel free to propose changes, or to see why certain decisions were made. As an interface to a version control system, GitHub provides tools that enable open development with history tracking and decision accountability. Just as open-source software is developed publicly, we develop this curriculum publicly.

## Getting started

If you don't already have one, create a GitHub account. To learn the basics of GitHub, read [this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). The tutorial will give you everything you need to contribute to the curriculum.

In order to make modifications, you need to "fork" this repository. Learn about forking [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/). You may then use the skills learned in the first tutorial to edit the README right in the GitHub web interface. Once you've made your edits, open a pull request!

## Topic discussion

We will use the repository issue tracker to track curriculum ideas and discussions. Learn about the issue tracker [here](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Please join the discussion with the knowledge that all issues are tracked and searchable for all of time.
